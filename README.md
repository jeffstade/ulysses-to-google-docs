Stylesheet to export Ulysses to Google Docs

# How to use

Ulysses is great for Markdown, but there's no great way to export from Ulysses to Google Docs.

Copying and pasting as rich text ends up losing styles. Use this stylesheet to retain Google Docs default styles when copy and pasting HTML from Ulysses.

You can import this stylesheet into Ulysses by:

1. Go to Preferences > Styles
2. Duplicate an existing HTML style by right-clicking on it and selecting Duplicate from the menu
3. Right click on the duplicated style to edit it. Paste in the "Google Docs" stylesheet contents
4. Rename the duplicated style to "Google Docs"
5. Now when previewing a document, select HTML format, then select the Google Docs stlye
6. Copy and paste into Google Docs.
